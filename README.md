# PAMDA-Wireframe-Prototype

In this project you can find the work of PAMDA team regarding the Wireframe and Prototype of a Video Game Streaming Service Web App Prototype. 

First we created a wireframe, and then developed it into an interactive prototype using Adobe XD. We proceeded by performing user testing, a combination of user
interviews and usability testing, and used the results of testing to improve our original prototype.
